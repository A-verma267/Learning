// here we gonna learn about what is Node.js is ?

// Node.js is the library that help us to use the js code in the server if.e to make the js a backend code...

// if we wanna to know the version of the Node.js that can be done like 
//  go to terminal and type node --version 
//  if u want to make the json fiel so that u can use that later that can be done by "npm init " which help to create a json file which contain all the information about the code 
//  then we can download the dependencies using "npm install slugify(which help use to manipulate the wrong data with the right one ) express(which is use to create a server), and soon";
//  if u delete the node modules then u can see it again just by writing "npm install" in terminal ;
// nodemon is use to start the server automatically if there is any change in the data;
